# Refactor of adventure.py

It appears you've provided a Python file named `adventure.py` which contains a `DungeonCraft` class and several functions for extracting, normalizing, and inferring data about Dungeons & Dragons adventures from HTML.

Based on your request to decompose the class for better separation of concerns, here's a refactoring proposal focusing on creating more focused classes and modules:

**Current Concerns in `adventure.py`:**

1.  **Data Model (`DungeonCraft` class):** This class currently acts as a data container but also includes some display logic (`convert_date_to_readable_str`) and validation/query methods (`is_tier`, `is_hour`, `is_campaign`).
2.  **Data Extraction (HTML Parsing):** The `_extract_raw_data_from_html` function is solely responsible for scraping data from the HTML, which is a distinct concern.
3.  **Data Normalization and Conversion:** `_normalize_and_convert_data` handles converting raw extracted strings into proper data types (integers, dates, lists) and inferring initial codes/campaigns.
4.  **Data Inference/Derivation:** `_infer_missing_adventure_data` attempts to fill in missing information based on existing data (e.g., deriving tier from APL).
5.  **Data Merging:** `merge_adventure_data` handles combining existing and new adventure data, with different strategies.
6.  **Utility Functions:** `sanitize_filename`, `str_to_int`, `get_patt_first_matching_group`, `get_dc_code_and_campaign`, `get_season` are general utilities.
7.  **Constants:** `DC_CAMPAIGNS`, `DDAL_CAMPAIGN`, `SEASONS` are configuration/lookup data.

**Proposed Decomposition:**

Here's a breakdown into new modules/classes to achieve better separation of concerns:

**1. `adventure_model.py` (Data Model)**

  * **`Adventure` Class:** This would be a Pydantic `BaseModel` or a simple data class. It should *only* define the structure and types of an adventure. It should *not* contain logic for extracting, normalizing, or inferring data, nor display logic.
      * Attributes: `product_id`, `full_title`, `title` (short), `authors`, `code`, `date_created`, `hours`, `tiers`, `apl`, `level_range`, `url`, `campaigns`, `season`, `is_adventure`, `price`.
      * Perhaps a static method `__get_short_title` could remain if it's purely a property of the title and doesn't involve external data.

**2. `adventure_extractor.py` (HTML Extraction)**

  * **`AdventureHTMLExtractor` Class:**
      * Responsibility: Takes BeautifulSoup parsed HTML and extracts *raw* data strings and lists.
      * Method: `extract_raw_data(parsed_html, product_id)`
      * This class would encapsulate the `_extract_raw_data_from_html` logic.
      * It should not attempt to parse or convert these raw strings into final types (e.g., hours should remain as the raw string "1-2 hours").

**3. `adventure_normalizer.py` (Data Normalization and Conversion)**

  * **`AdventureDataNormalizer` Class:**
      * Responsibility: Takes the *raw data* extracted by `AdventureHTMLExtractor` and converts it into appropriate Python types (e.g., "1-2 hours" to `"1-2"` or a list of integers, "Tier 1" to `1`). It also performs initial derivation of `code`, `campaigns`, and `season` based on `DC_CAMPAIGNS`, `DDAL_CAMPAIGN`, and `SEASONS`.
      * Method: `normalize_data(raw_adventure_data)`
      * This would encapsulate the `_normalize_and_convert_data` logic.
      * It would depend on the `constants.py` for lookup tables.

**4. `adventure_inferer.py` (Data Inference/Derivation)**

  * **`AdventureDataInferer` Class:**
      * Responsibility: Takes the *normalized data* and infers missing values or refines existing ones based on logical rules (e.g., deriving `tier` from `apl`, `level_range` from `tier`, or determining `is_adventure`).
      * Method: `infer_missing_data(normalized_adventure_data)`
      * This would encapsulate the `_infer_missing_adventure_data` logic.

**5. `adventure_merger.py` (Data Merging Logic)**

  * **`AdventureDataMerger` Class:**
      * Responsibility: Provides methods for merging two `Adventure` objects (or dictionaries representing them) based on specified strategies (force\_overwrite, careful\_mode).
      * Method: `merge_adventure_data(existing_data, new_data, force_overwrite, careful_mode)` (this can remain a standalone function if it doesn't hold state).

**6. `utils.py` (General Utilities)**

  * **Standalone Functions:**
      * `sanitize_filename(filename)`
      * `str_to_int(value)`
      * `get_patt_first_matching_group(regex, text)`
      * These are generic helper functions not tied specifically to adventure processing.

**7. `constants.py` (Configuration/Lookup Data)**

  * **Module-level Constants:**
      * `DC_CAMPAIGNS`
      * `DDAL_CAMPAIGN`
      * `SEASONS`
      * These are lookup tables that other modules will import.

**8. `adventure_service.py` (Orchestration/Service Layer)**

  * **`AdventureService` Class:**
      * Responsibility: Orchestrates the entire process. It would take a URL (or HTML content), call the `AdventureHTMLExtractor`, then `AdventureDataNormalizer`, then `AdventureDataInferer`, and finally, potentially use `AdventureDataMerger` if combining with existing data. It would then return an `Adventure` object.
      * This class would manage the flow and dependencies between the new, more focused components.

**Revised `adventure.py` (Main Script/Entry Point):**

This file would become much smaller, primarily acting as the entry point, orchestrating the calls to the service layer.

**Example of the new structure and interactions:**

```
project_root/
├── adventure_model.py
├── adventure_extractor.py
├── adventure_normalizer.py
├── adventure_inferer.py
├── adventure_merger.py
├── utils.py
├── constants.py
└── adventure_service.py
└── main.py (or the current adventure.py acting as main)
```

**Benefits of this Decomposition:**

  * **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each module and class has a single, well-defined responsibility.
  * **Maintainability:** Changes to HTML parsing logic (e.g., if the website structure changes) would be confined to `adventure_extractor.py`, without affecting normalization or inference.
  * **Testability:** Each component can be tested in isolation. You can easily mock raw data for `AdventureDataNormalizer` without needing actual HTML, for instance.
  * **Readability:** The code becomes easier to understand as different concerns are clearly separated.
  * **Reusability:** Utility functions and even the data model can be easily reused in other parts of a larger application.
  * **Flexibility:** If you later want to get data from a different source (e.g., an API instead of HTML), you could create a new `AdventureAPIExtractor` without touching the other components.

This refactoring will make your codebase much more robust and scalable.
