The system allows you to play any setting using a standard deck of playing cards.\n\nThe system focuses on creativity and providing meaningful choices.  The deck building system allows players to control their luck through the choices they make. The system has a stronger focus on combat than on narrative but provides plenty of tools to create exciting and tense narrative moments that reward players thinking outside the box. The combat is a tactical and deadly hex based system.\n\nThe skill system, magic, and maneuvers are flexible and can easily be adapted to fit any setting or story.  For players and Dealers looking for a more narrative focused system, C22 Light is a work in progress version that lessens the crunch while still maintaining the ability for players to control their luck through their choices made building their personal deck."
