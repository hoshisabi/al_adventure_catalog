# Purpose of this directory

This directory should store the files that you've downloaded from DM's Guild so that they can be processed.

We are not checking those files into the repository so that we avoid any sort of copyright issues, we'll just
store the data files that contains information about the adventures, not the descriptive text or anything like that.

Let's be good citizens. :)
