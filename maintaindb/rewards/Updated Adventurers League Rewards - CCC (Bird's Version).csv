Flowering hop vines are entwined around the shaft of this light, pale wooden staff. No matter what object(s) float atop it, it smells like fresh hops.

Tankard of Sobriety
The stern face sculpted into the side of this tankard is that of a human man in his late 30s with a finely groomed mustache and beard, and a monocle.","Great!
Mediocre!
Dismal!","Great!
The beer is a rousing success, and many say that it has no equal in all of the Moonsea. You can expect to be treated quite well by connoisseurs and enthusiasts everywhere—if you can convince them you actually played a part in the brewing.

Mediocre!
The beer is palatable and still better than your average swill. While it carries some distinctive flavors to set it apart from the rest, most people find the tale of its brewing to be more enjoyable than the beer itself.

Dismal!
The beer is little more than bitter water that barkeeps across the Moonsea ply their most drunken customers with in order to save the good stuff and make a little extra coin. While the tale of the brewing was no doubt exciting, linking your name to it won’t get you much respect from even the amateur beer enthusiasts.",,"Cormanthor Forest, Elmwood",Cascadian Legacy,5 1-hour mini-adventures and 1 2-hour mini-adventure

You have done something to grievously wound the gnomish Cloisternook family. Perhaps you insulted their honor, or perhaps you caused irreparable damage to Darkglitter Depths.

Feast of the Hound
The corrupted machine deep in the Darkglitter Depths drew in your essence, and in those terrifying final moments you saw something: an emaciated hound, gargantuan in size, feasting upon the souls of those that arrived before you. It gleefully tore them asunder, and then turned to you. As its teeth sank into your metaphysical flesh and you felt the hot stink of its breath wash over you, you were pulled back to the world – but not without a reminder: you have the scars of a dog’s bite somewhere on your body, and sometimes those scars stink and fester when in the presence of clerics and paladins.

This gem carried with it an enchantment that caused goblins to become ferocious and feral while being biddable by the bearer. The origins of the gem are unknown, but Antola intends to find out and may call upon you to help her.

Witwulf’s Spellbook
You have retrieved the spellbook of Bronal Witwulf. The spellbook turned out to be an iron warhammer with an inscription that reads, “My Spellbook.” From the archives in Blodvahrer, you have learned that Bronal Witwulf was an adventurer infamous for acts of extreme strength and equally extreme lack of judgement. For a short time, his name featured prominently in the cautionary tales off Gnarhelm, but his fame has completely faded.

Twin Destinies
While visiting the town of Bloodvahrer you came across a pair of twins, Yrsa and Gulli, who have arcane abilities. Blodvahrer is not a hospitable place for arcane casters at this time, and when the twins approached you for help in leaving town, you gave it.
    Traveling with the twins, even if for a short while has shown you that their powers are quickly growing in strength, but that unfortunately their control of them is not growing at an equal speed. It did however give you the chance to witness an actual rain of frogs.
    The twins left your company in Olafstaad to be reunited with their father who has joined a group called the Initiates of Flame. What the future holds for these two is anyone’s guess.

Ice Cold Killer
You were involved in the killing of a villager of Blodvahrer. Legally it may be that you were provoked, but it has gained you a reputation for ruthlessness, bordering on murder.

Capt. Bluto’s Blunderbuss
This smoke powder musket was owned by the feared giff pirate, Capt. Boris Blutovich. Possessing this item has both advantages and disadvantages in the Moonshaes. The item is first and foremost a deadly weapon. It is a martial ranged weapon that does 1d12 piercing damage, weighs 10 lbs., has a range of 40/120, and has the loading, two-handed firearms, and ammunition properties.
    Because of the age of the powder, there is a 25% chance that a shot misfires. If a misfire occurs, the bullet doesn’t discharge and the powder flashes, blinding the shooter until the end of its next turn. There are three silvered shot bullets, and just enough smoke powder left for each one. These shots may only be used during a Moonshae Isle adventure. If the character plays an adventure outside of the Moonshae Isles, the powder goes bad and is no longer usable.
    This item comes from another world and works unlike any other. Ammo and powder cannot be crafted for it. Once the three shots are used, or the powder goes bad, it becomes a mundane object and may never be operated again. It cannot be duplicated magically. This is NOT a magic item.
    The blunderbuss is a recognized item in the Moonshae region. Even those who haven’t seen it, may recognize it based on local stories. At the DM’s discretion, it may evoke strong reactions of celebration, fear, or anger. Pirates of Silver’s Blade react with deadly intent.

A Debt Owed in Silver
You have killed Capt. Bluto and now the pirates of Silver’s Blade seek you out for revenge. Through a variety of underworld contacts and possibly divinations, they have identified as the killer. They won’t rest until you’re as dead as Capt. Bluto, but there may be ways to buy them off in the future.",,,,

The Mind Fortress is the remnants of an extradimensional location that served as the site of a ritual enacted by the alchemist Ravinan. Ravinan divided three aspects of his psyche, in an attempt to purify his soul, and collapsed this evil into a stone called the Eye of Darkness. The Mind Fortress then served as the extradimensional home for the stone until liberated by adventurers. After the stone was removed, the Mind Fortress shrank to a less-potent but still useful magical item. The Mind Fortress functions in all ways as a ring of mind shielding. 
    The Mind Fortress still contains two portions of Rhys’s psyche (his center for rational thought, as well as his conscience). These mental remnants do not count as an actual soul for purposes of the ring, nor do they cause the Mind Fortress to act as an intelligent item. However, a DM might choose to have these aspects of Rhys’s psyche may affect the emotional state of the wearer or interact with the wearer during a dream or trance state.

The flame can provide dim light within 5 feet of you.

Doomguide of Kelemvor
At the end of the adventure, you have been asked by Rizgrim, an archpriest of Kelemvor if you wish to become a priest for the lord of the dead and probably join her on next year’s pilgrimage. Should you agree, Rizgrim will perform a small baptism ceremony for you at the Valhingen Graveyard.
    You are now an official priest of Kelemvor, also known as a Doomguide. You have received a set of smoky grey priestly vestments with the symbol of Kelemvor and a cowled cloak with a white domino mask that emanates harmless blue flame whenever you wear it.

Until that time, having it in your possession will make for a “sweet” story piece and may bring the attention of curious others that wonder how YOU obtained it.

Magenta’s Thanks
The daughter of Filaeren Xilofane wraps a silk scarf around the neck of one player. The magenta-hued scarf looks gaudy, but it is stitched with golden thread. The Sunboughs Sigil of a woodland wreath with a honeycomb at its center is embroidered into the scarf. Being in possession of the scarf identifies its owner as a friend of the wood elves of the Sunboughs, which may come in handy in future adventurers in the region.

The Sting of the Zors
Word of your transgressions in The Sunboughs “matter” have reached the ears of The Zors of Mulmaster. For the slight to their reputation, you and anyone in your party (while you are present) may find yourselves shunned by the Zors in any dealings you may have in the City of Danger, or in the Moonsea Region for that matter. Their influence is far-reaching … and they do not forget.

Bee Kind to Your Elders (Downtime)
At the end of the adventure the player can use the following downtime activity. The players can spend ten downtime days to wait for Elder Filaeren Xilofane to recover and to speak to him.
    Elder Xilofane, upon hearing of your effort to eradicate the source of the sickness that befell his people, has his faith in the alliance of elves and men bolstered. For Emerald Enclave affiliated players: If Xilofane has not committed to joining the Emerald Enclave, he does so now, accepting the pin and signing the letter of recruitment. For Zhentarim affiliated players: Xilofane convinces the gambler Durgin Lodepips to accept any offers to escort him back to Mulmaster. If the Zhentarim characters did not complete their faction assignment, they do so now.
    If the players spending downtime days in the above manner were not rewarded the Story Reward, “A Jar of Gratitude” during the adventures, then they are at this time.
    In addition, any player that uses this downtime activity is able to take advantage of the sanctity and seclusion of Sunboughs. You enjoy room and board at a Modest Lifestyle with no costs, and you can complete any one downtime activity (other than this one) at half the downtime day costs and expenses.

    You did also learn that The Hawks change their tactics and techniques frequently, so once you used what you have learned, it will no longer be effective. Agent Garz apologizes as you remove this Downtime Activity from your log.

Keeping your word, you promised not to reveal to anyone that Marilynth was in Mulmaster nor that she does not want to return to the Sunboughs.

Chaotic Blessing of the Queen of Spiders
You have drawn the attentions of Lloth to you, and she has noticed your prowess in battle. In recognition for slaying the mind flayer masquerading as one of her beloved driders, she has granted you a blessing, but you hardly feel blessed by it. What effect this has on your future adventuring career remains to be seen.

A remove curse cast at 9th level or a wish can end this effect, as can a successful Divine Intervention by a deity not allied to Lloth. At that point, you should strike through this paragraph, but retain the first one.

Gave it to someone else: That’s really sad.
Kept it: Congratulations! You have a dense, academic tome on the study of the elements and their impact on reality. Wandering about, adventuring, dungeon delving – not really all that conducive to studying, are they? Perhaps you should keep this at the bottom of your pack until you need a unique book to get in somewhere, like Candlekeep. Void this award if you ever give up the book.
Gave it to Rastol Shan: Shan is delighted with your gift, and offers to let you study the tome with him. For every 10 downtime days you spend studying the tome with him, he is able to produce a spell scroll of one level of spell from the Elemental Evil Player’s Companion and give it to you. If you choose to instead wait, multiple units of 10 days can be combined for higher level scrolls. After 60 days of study, Shan unfortunately has no more time to examine the book. During your study with him, you are expected to look and act the part of a respected researcher, so you must maintain a wealthy lifestyle, at a minimum.

Though joining the Cloaks is mandatory for any arcanists seeking to stay in Mulmaster for an extended period of time, and sponsorship is not required, Zora Culkin's sponsorship will definitely have its perks.

Learn the Culture (Mulmaster) (Downtime)
You may spend 5 downtime days (and the associated lifestyle cost) in Mulmaster touring the city and learning the history of the region. You gain advantage on any single ability check relating to Mulmaster, the Brotherhood of the Cloaks, the cults of Elemental Evil, or the Red Wizards of Thay or on any single attack against an elemental or undead creature. Once the advantage benefit has been used, you may return to Mulmaster every time you gain a level and perform this quest again by spending the required downtime and lifestyle expenses.","Mage's Spellbook

After nearly five years of roaming the north, the barbarian finally located the weapon and reclaimed it by defeating a sea hag near Luskan named Mirta Spleencarver. He returned to his people a hero and quickly ascended to the position of chieftain himself.
    Throughout his rule, Kralgar Bonesnapper struggled endlessly to fulfill his goal of conquering and ruling one of the great cities of the North. When the orcs and giants rallied against Luruar, Conarg saw a chance to fulfill his dream and become the greatest Uthgardt chieftain that ever lived. He used the axe’s unique properties to inspire his kin to ally with the orcs and giants in War of the Silver Marches.
    Unfortunately for Conarg, the Griffon tribe came to an untimely end fighting the dwarves of Mithral Hall, Citadel Adbar, and Citadel Felbar, and his axe was lost on the field of battle. It later resurfaced in the Moonsea region.",,,,Hulburg,,

Talindra’s Brooch is an exquisite piece of artwork. A silver dragon curls around a piece of amethyst. A fleck of ruby is set in the dragons eye, a circle of gold enclosing the whole piece. It is a piece of jewelry fit for Cormyrian royalty. They will be very glad to get it back.
    The jeweler to whom you sought to sell the piece to immediately closes his shop and sends out his assistant while he appraises the piece. He hems and haws over the value, checking ledgers and showing you drawings of other pieces and what those pieces sold for in comparison. But he does not have to stall long; the assistant returns with a full company of the watch in short order. They even bring magical support.
    You spend the next three days in jail, as you plead your innocence and deny all knowledge that the brooch had been stolen from the Corymyrian Royal Vaults. Apparently, it was quite the theft. The most powerful divination magic of Cormyr’s famed wizard college failed to turn up any clues. But eventually your story checks out. The staff at Hofstead’s beacon confirm that a woman matching Talindra’s description was pulled from the wreck and went with the other survivors to Mulmaster.
    From Mulmaster the trail goes cold. No one there remembers seeing her, even though you spend several days and no small amount of gold trying to locate her. Even divination magic fails. She has slipped through your grasp for now. But the Cormyrian authorities remain wary of you and circulate your description.

Corbin Tusslefoot, traveler and linguist owes you his life. In gratitude, he will suspend his travels and waives his usual fees to help you learn a new language. Corbin speaks and can tutor you in Dwarvish, Elven, Giant, and Draconic.
    Normally it costs 250 downtime days to learn a new language. With the help of a language tutor you may learn a new language by spending only 200 downtime days. Alternatively, if you already have another means of reducing the number of downtime days required to learn a language, such as a faction benefit, you may reduce the cost by 25 days. You may use multiple language tutors to reduce the cost of learning a language, but each tutor may only help you learn a particular language once. If you earn multiple copies of a particular language tutor award, that tutor may help you learn one new language for each instance of the award you have. Use of a language tutor story award may not reduce the cost to learn a language to less than 100 downtime days.","Rider's Spellbook

This shortsword appears rusted at first glance, but that is due to the unique crimson-orange color of the metal. Combined with this color, a triangular white mother-of-pearl inlay near the hilt causes the blade to resemble the coloring of a fox’s tail. The crossguard is made of the same unique crimson metal, set with round yellow and black stones made to resemble vulpine eyes. This description matches that of a magical weapon lost during Ylraphon’s destruction by dragons in the 14th century. Said to have been crafted by forest gnomes, it was known as the Foxblade.

You took too long to reach the tower, and do not have enough time to complete it by activating the magical candle you were given at dawn unless you do not take a long rest. Mark this down as either “Took Too Long: Short Rest Only” or “Took Too Long: Unprotected by the Candle.”
    If you choose “Took Too Long: Short Rest Only”, take the benefits of a short rest, then record your current hit points, spell slots, uses of features and traits, and other resources that might be restored to some degree by a long rest. You begin your next adventure in this exact state (subject to any expenditures of downtime or any benefits to gaining a level if you gain one).
    If you choose “Took Too Long: Unprotected by the Candle”, you can take a long rest, but you do not benefit from the magical candle’s protections against the defenses of the temple. (If you play the adventure SRCC1-3 The Altar of the Smoldering Eye, this will be a major disadvantage.)

Written a century ago by a deranged clone of the archmage Halaster Blackcloak, this thin leather-bound tome is a glimpse into the mind of a madman. Its first half consists of wildly inaccurate theories on matters of astrology, but the latter appendices include excellent academic studies of the moon and the Selûnite faith, as well as a perfect almanac for predicting the moon’s phases.
    Consulting this book grants advantage on all Intelligence checks related to the moon, its phases and movements, or the religion of Selûne. If consulted on matters of divination or astrology, however, it grants disadvantage on all related Intelligence checks. In addition, the last third of the book functions as a spellbook, containing the following wizard spells:
1st : chromatic orb, find familar, ice knife, Tasha's hideous laughter
2nd : crown of madness, Maximilian's earthen grasp
3rd : erupting earth, tidal wave

Local Pursuit
Ylraphon Adventurers Guild","Caveat Venditor
You managed to disperse a swarm of pixies from the Chiang Emporium in Ylraphon with minimal damage to the shop. Your reputation for mastery and grace precedes you amongst members of the Chiang Emporium.

An Emberstar Exclusive
You’ve gained the favor of Sebastian Emberstar after rescuing his employees from a lynch mob. In gratitude, he grants you an exclusive offer: access to their forges. You have the one-time opportunity to provide your own funds to add decorative flourishes to a weapon you own (gems in the hilt, embossed or filigree in the blades, etc). You can spend any amount, but if you spend at least 10,000 gold, the weapon’s craftsmanship impresses those who view it and know about such things. At the DM’s option, once per adventure you can gain advantage on a Charisma-based ability check by flourishing or displaying the weapon.

The Moonmaiden’s Waters
You foiled an attack on the Moonwater, preventing Vanquo from taking control of the temple. While the temples’ famous prophetic baths were befouled, the High Initiate, Andorran Bree, has offered you an opportunity to use them once the waters are suitably cleansed.

…A Terrible Thing to Waste
You fell in battle against the minions of a renegade mind flayer. But an adventurer’s brain — even when not taken alive — is a delicacy few mind flayers could resist. Selfless heroics add such a delicious spice! Your story ends here, although your demise spares you from spending your days as a mindless thrall — a fate your compatriots are likely to share.

Local Pursuit
You have become involved with a local institution in Ylraphon. You may choose one (and only one) of the “Local Pursuit” story award options described in Player Handout 6Y: Local Pursuits for successfully completing this adventure. This signifies your character having the opportunity to become more involved with day-to-day life and significant institutions in Ylraphon. You may gain only one of the story award options listed for completing this adventure, though you may later gain additional ones if other adventures grant these story award options.

Ylraphon Adventurers Guild
You may join the Ylraphon Adventurers Guild if you either obtain one of the Local Pursuit story awards (as described above) or are willing to pay 50 gp initial dues as described in Player Handout 6Z: The Ylraphon Adventurers Guild. This grants access to the Guild Delving downtime activity described in that handout, as well as other benefits to be seen in future modules set in Ylraphon.","Vanquo's Spellbook

You bargained with sea hags, trading lives or goods for the benefit of those wicked creatures. They promised you a boon of luck, and the hags deliver on that promise: you have received a boon of bad luck.
    The next time you receive a point of Inspiration, it works in reverse, forcing you to roll with Disadvantage when you spend that point of Inspiration. As per the usual rule, you cannot have more than one point of Inspiration at a time, so you must spend any Inspiration you receive before you can get another one. Once this happens three times, this boon loses its effect, but the story award remains.

Chiang Goodwill
Your service to the Chiang Emporium has earned you their respect. Word of your deeds travels fast between the Chiang’s numerous mercantile posts. From there, your reputation spreads among Shou communities throughout the Sword Coast and beyond.

Additionally, you gain advantage on those same checks that involve Shou individuals who are friendly or neutral towards House Chiang and the reigning Shou empire.
