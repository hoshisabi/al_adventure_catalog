feat: Sanitize filenames to handle periods before extension

Modified `sanitize_filename` in `adventure.py` to correctly handle periods in filenames.

Previously, all periods were replaced with dashes, which could corrupt file extensions.

The updated function now:
- Splits the filename into base name and extension.
- Replaces non-alphanumeric characters (including periods) with dashes only in the base name.
- Preserves the original file extension.

This ensures that filenames like `EB-SALVAGE-RSM-T4.4-Daughter-of-Khyber.json` are correctly sanitized without altering the `.json` extension.
