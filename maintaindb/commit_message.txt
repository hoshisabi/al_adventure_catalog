feat: Improve hours parsing and filename sanitization

- Modified `sanitize_filename` in `adventure.py` to correctly handle periods in filenames.
  Previously, all periods were replaced with dashes, which could corrupt file extensions.
  The updated function now:
  - Splits the filename into base name and extension.
  - Replaces non-alphanumeric characters (including periods) with dashes only in the base name.
  - Preserves the original file extension.

- Removed redundant `hours = None` assignment in `extract_data_from_html` to ensure correct parsing of hours for EB- series adventures.
