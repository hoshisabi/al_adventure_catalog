🗂️ Adventure Catalog Kickstart Pack

- When starting a new session, include these files (upload in chat):
- TASKS.md → current roadmap / action items
  - README.md → project overview & goals
  - GEMINI.md → process notes / meta context (optional, nice-to-have)
  - REFACTOR.md → any specific refactor directions you want active (optional)
  - Optional but useful
    - all_adventures.json → master data dump (so I can sanity check against real entries)
    - Any one example fixture (HTML or parsed JSON) if you want me to test 
      or demonstrate parsing/refactor logic concretely
