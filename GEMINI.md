## Gemini Notes for Windows `jq` and Verification

- When running `jq` commands with filters or complex expressions on Windows, it's often necessary to write the `jq` command to a temporary batch file (e.g., `temp_jq_command.bat`) and then execute the batch file. This helps bypass quoting issues with `cmd.exe`.
- After running `maintaindb/aggregator.py`, it's crucial to verify the `all_adventures.json` file using `jq` to ensure the data is correctly aggregated and formatted. For example, to check the `hours` field for a specific adventure:
  ```
  jq ".[] | select(.full_title == \"Your Adventure Title\") | .hours" assets/data/all_adventures.json
  ```
  Remember to use a temporary batch file for this command on Windows.

## Project Tasks

```bash
python -m unittest discover maintaindb
```

**Requirements:**
- `word2number` Python library: `pip install word2number`

## Unit Testing

## Gemini Workspace

This directory (`gemini_workspace/`) is used for temporary files, one-off scripts, and internal notes generated by the Gemini agent. Its contents are intentionally untracked by Git (added to `.gitignore`).

## Data Caution: `maintaindb/_dc` Directory

**Important:** The `maintaindb/_dc` directory contains JSON files that are generated from various sources, including the DMsGuild RSS feed and manually processed HTML files. Some of these files, particularly those derived from older or manually processed data, may contain information that cannot be easily regenerated. Therefore, exercise extreme caution when modifying or deleting files within this directory. Always ensure a backup or Git restoration plan is in place before performing destructive operations.
